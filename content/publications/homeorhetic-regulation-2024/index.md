This paper investigates homeorhetic regulation mechanisms in cellular phenotype dynamics.
How cells translate growth factor (GF) signals into context-specific phenotypes remains a fundamental question in cell biology. The classical view holds that cells translate a constant concentration of a GF with specific chemical identity to a steady state activation of the underlying signaling pathway, resulting in a defined phenotypic response. However, recent findings suggest that even a single GF, when presented in a pulsatile manner, drives differential phenotypic responses depending on the frequency of stimulation. To reconcile these views, we introduce a novel conceptual framework of "signaling homeorhesis". Unlike homeostasis, homeorhesis describes the stable evolution of signaling trajectories over time. Defining this concept quantitatively using a dynamical systems framework, we use mathematical models of the Epidermal Factor Growth Receptor (EGFR) and the Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) networks, as well as available experimental temporal protein activity recordings in PC-12 cells to demonstrate that cells classify GF signals to unique signaling trajectories that encode for distinct cell phenotypes, irrespective of the GF identity. We thereby propose that the cellular phenotype is determined in real-time, as the cell actively interprets the growth factor signals from its environment.
