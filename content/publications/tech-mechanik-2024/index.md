 we examine the potential for integrating AI into theengineering design process, using the V-model from the VDI guideline 2206, considered the state-of-the-art in product design, as afoundation. We identify and classify AI methods based on their suitability for specific stages within the engineering product designworkflow. Furthermore, we present a series of application examples where AI-assisted design has been successfully implementedby the authors. These examples, drawn from research projects within the German Research Foundation (DFG) Priority ProgramSPP 2353: Daring More Intelligence - Design Assistants in Mechanics and Dynamics, showcase a diverse range of applicationsacross mechanics and mechatronics, including areas such as acoustics and robotics.
