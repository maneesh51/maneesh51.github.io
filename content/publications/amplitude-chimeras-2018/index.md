We explore the behavior of groups of Landau-Stuart oscillators, with diffusive mean-field coupling within the group and indirect inter-group coupling mediated by a common medium. Interestingly, we find that oscillations are revived in groups with fixed point dynamics by coupling to an oscillatory group through the common medium. We also investigate groups of Hindmarsh–Rose model neurons and demonstrate the emergence of spiking in indirectly coupled inactive neuronal groups, indicating the vital role of the common medium in restoring oscillations.
