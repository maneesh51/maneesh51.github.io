In this work, we introduced a task-driven network pruning framework, starting from a large reservoir and iteratively removing nodes while optimizing performance. Results show:
- Pruned networks retain—often improve—accuracy
- Structural metrics such as spectral radius, out-degree, and **input–readout asymmetry** reorganize systematically
- Pruning reveals functionally critical subnetworks within Erdős-Rényi random networks.
