**Developing a theoretical framework to explain biochemical information processing in living cells through transient dynamics - the foundation of cellular computation and real-time biological decision making.**

<!--more-->

## Project Overview

This research project, conducted as part of my **PhD thesis** at the Max Planck Institute for Neurobiology of Behavior - caesar, explores how living cells process information through transient dynamics in biochemical networks. Rather than focusing on steady states, this work reveals how **transient responses** serve as the fundamental computational units in biological systems.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Core Concept: Transients as Information Carriers
The central hypothesis is that **transient dynamics** - the temporary responses of biochemical networks to stimuli - carry more information than previously recognized and serve as the primary mechanism for cellular computation.

### Key Research Questions
- How do biochemical networks encode and process information through transient responses?
- What computational capabilities emerge from transient dynamics in cellular systems?
- How can we develop mathematical frameworks to quantify information processing in biochemical networks?

## Research Methodology

### Theoretical Development
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Development of novel theoretical frameworks for transient-based information processing
- **Network Analysis**: Investigation of biochemical network topologies that optimize information processing
- **Information Theory**: Application of information-theoretic measures to quantify computational capacity
- **Evolutionay Analysis**: Analyzed protein interation networks of 14 different species to identify which parts of networks are conserved over the evolution. 

### Biological Applications
- **Cellular Signaling**: Analysis of how cells use transients for decision-making processes
- **Real-time Processing**: Understanding how cells achieve rapid responses through transient dynamics
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Exploration of how transient-based computation enables cellular adaptation

## Key Contributions

### Novel Theoretical Framework
Development of a comprehensive theory explaining how:
- **Transient responses** with *metastable states* encode information more efficiently than steady-state dynamics
- **Network topology** influences information processing capabilities
- **Real-time computation** emerges from transient biochemical dynamics

### Biological Insights
- Demonstration that cells utilize transient dynamics for rapid information processing
- Identification of network motifs that optimize transient-based computation
- Understanding of how biochemical noise affects information transmission

## Research Impact

### Scientific Significance
This work bridges **systems biology** and **information theory**, providing new perspectives on:
- How biological systems perform computation without traditional digital components
- The role of dynamics (rather than steady states) in biological information processing
- Novel computational paradigms inspired by biological systems

### Broader Applications
The theoretical insights have implications for:
- **Synthetic Biology**: Design of artificial biochemical networks with enhanced computational capabilities
- **Bio-inspired Computing**: Development of new computational architectures based on transient dynamics

## Related Work

### PhD Thesis Context
This project formed the core of my **PhD dissertation** on "Theory of real-time biochemical computations with transients," supervised by Dr. Aneta Koseska at MPI-NB caesar, Bonn.

### Publication Outcomes
The research has resulted in several publications, including work on [homeorhetic regulation](/publications/homeorhetic-regulation-2024/), demonstrating the practical applications of transient-based information processing in biological systems.

### Technological Applications
- Translation of biological computation principles to artificial systems
- Development of bio-inspired algorithms for real-time processing
- Integration with current work on [physical reservoir computing](/projects/scikit/)
