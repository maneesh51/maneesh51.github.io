[A Berlin University Alliance (BUA) Course](https://www.berlin-university-alliance.de/commitments/teaching-learning/sturop/research-groups/index.html) for engaging students with hands on research by building a Physical ML device that run on water and **helping young scientists lead research groups**. Here is the main [project page.](https://www.tu.berlin/cpsme/studium-lehre/lehrveranstaltungen/x-student-research-group) 

## My role as a Young Group Leader – Project & Team Leadership

As a young group leader, I design and lead interdisciplinary research projects that connect machine learning, physics, and engineering. For my BUA-funded X-Student Research Group **"Physical Reservoir Computing: AI in a Bucket of Water"**, I developed the complete concept—from proposal writing to course structure, research design, and team organization.

### Leadership Roles

- **Grant Acquisition & Project Design**  
  Conceived the project idea, wrote the successful BUA proposal, and created the full research and teaching plan.

- **Course & Structure Development**  
  Designed a clear three-phase program (theory → implementation → results) with defined roles, milestones, and deliverables.

- **Team Leadership & Mentoring**  
  Guided an interdisciplinary student group, facilitated collaboration, and provided continuous scientific and technical supervision.

- **Organization & Project Management**  
  Coordinated weekly schedules, managed work division (in-silico RC vs. physical RC), and ensured smooth progress and documentation.

- **Research Training**  
  Supported students in scientific methods, coding, experimental work, and communicating their results.

## Project: Physical Reservoir Computing – AI in a Bucket of Water

This project explores an unconventional form of AI that uses the natural dynamics of water as a computational system. Ripples on the water surface act as a physical reservoir computer: the reservoir is excited by small disturbances, recorded with a camera, and processed through a simple linear readout. This creates an **energy-efficient and nature-inspired machine learning system** and serves as a demonstrator for sustainable AI.

## Team Structure

- **Group 1: In-Silico Reservoir Computing**  
  Develop RC algorithms, solve benchmark tasks, and explore novel applications.

- **Group 2: Physical Reservoir Computing Setup**  
  Build the water-based RC system, including hardware, micro-controller control, and video-based signal processing.

## Outcomes

- A working physical Reservoir Computer based on water  
- Open-source code, hardware documentation, and datasets  
- Posters and presentations for BUA outreach and scientific events
