- **Principal Investigator**: [Prof. Dr. Merten Stender](https://www.tu.berlin/cpsme/ueber-uns/leitung)
- **Postdoctoral Researcher**: [Dr. Manish Yadav](/)


## Project Overview

The DIRC (Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing) project aims to develop novel design assistants with regard to complex dynamic loads in structural dynamics using dynamically integrated methods of machine learning. The core focus is on reservoir computing approaches for fast and green machine learning.

## Research Goals

- **Dynamics-informed machine learning**: Building design assistants based on dynamics-informed ML approaches specifically tailored for structural mechanics applications
- **Reservoir Computing**: Developing fast and energy-efficient computing paradigms using reservoir networks
- **Performance-dependent network evolution**: Understanding how network structures evolve to optimize computational performance
- **Structure-function relationships**: Investigating the relationship between network topology and computational capabilities
