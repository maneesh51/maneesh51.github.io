## Revolutionary AI Computing with Water

The TU Berlin Annual Magazine **[Wir/Vier 2024](https://www.tu.berlin/news/wir-vier-die-tu-berlin-in-der-berlin-university-alliance-bua/x-steht-fuer-exzellenz)** featured our groundbreaking Physical Reservoir Computing project as its **cover story**, highlighting the revolutionary approach to artificial intelligence that uses the natural dynamics of water as a computational system. This unprecedented recognition brings international attention to TU Berlin's innovative research in sustainable AI technologies.

## The Physical Reservoir Computing Project

### Project Overview
The **["Physical Reservoir Computing: AI in a Bucket of Water"](/projects/scikit/)** project, funded by the Berlin University Alliance (BUA), represents a paradigm shift in machine learning approaches. Instead of traditional digital neural networks, this innovative system harnesses the **natural dynamics of water ripples** to perform complex computations.

### How It Works
- **Physical Reservoir**: Water surface acts as the computational medium
- **Input Mechanism**: Small disturbances create ripples on the water surface  
- **Data Capture**: High-speed cameras record the evolving ripple patterns
- **Processing**: Linear readout systems process the captured dynamics
- **Output**: Complex pattern recognition and machine learning tasks are solved

### Key Innovation
This approach creates an **energy-efficient and nature-inspired machine learning system** that serves as a demonstrator for sustainable AI. The water-based system offers a fundamentally different computational paradigm compared to energy-intensive traditional AI systems.

## Research Leadership & Team Structure

### Young Group Leader Excellence
As the project's **Young Group Leader**, Dr. Manish Yadav designed and led this interdisciplinary research initiative that connects:
- **Machine Learning** algorithms and theory
- **Physics** of fluid dynamics and wave propagation  
- **Engineering** hardware and control systems

## Scientific Impact & Innovation

### Sustainable AI Computing
The research addresses critical challenges in modern AI:
- **Energy Efficiency**: Dramatically reduced computational energy requirements
- **Natural Computing**: Leveraging physical processes for information processing
- **Scalability**: Potential for large-scale sustainable AI implementations

### Educational Impact
The project serves multiple educational purposes:
