# Navigation Links
#   To link a homepage widget, specify the URL as a hash `#` followed by the filename of the
  #     desired widget in your `content/home/` folder.
  #   The weight parameter defines the order that the links will appear in.
  #   Use `identifier` and `parent` for dropdown menus:
  #     - Parent items need an `identifier` and no `url` (or a url if clickable)
  #     - Child items need a `parent` matching the parent's `identifier`
